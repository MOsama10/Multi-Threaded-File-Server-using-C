**Title: Multi-threaded File Server Implementation in C**

**Description:**

This repository hosts the implementation of a multi-threaded file server written in C, designed to address the limitations of conventional single-threaded servers in managing concurrent requests and large-scale data processing.

**Features:**

1. **Enhanced Scalability:** The server efficiently manages multiple threads of concurrent inquiries, optimizing resource utilization.
   
2. **Improved Throughput:** Requests are processed in parallel, effectively doubling the average throughput and reducing response times.
   
3. **Reduced Latency:** Concurrent users experience minimal delays as multiple threads handle requests simultaneously.

**Implementation Plan:**

- **Design Architecture:** Describes the general architecture of the multi-threaded file server, including thread control, request handling, and data storage components.
  
- **Thread Management:** Implements thread creation, synchronization, and termination routines to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
  
- **Request Handling:** Establishes methods for managing read and write procedures, ensuring data correctness and control.
  
- **Data Storage:** Utilizes data manipulation tools for file management, optimizing storage and retrieval processes.
  
- **Error Handling:** Ensures system stability through robust error handling techniques to manage exceptions effectively.
  
- **Testing and Optimization:** Conducts thorough testing to identify and address synchronization problems and performance bottlenecks, ensuring scalability and efficiency.

**Synchronization Concept:**

Utilizes synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, or locks to prevent data corruption and maintain consistency in multi-threaded contexts. Ensures integrity by synchronizing access to critical code segments.

**Additional Features:**

- **Concurrency Control:** Implements procedures to limit the widest range of concurrent connections, preventing server overload.
  
- **Caching:** Utilizes caching techniques to reduce disk I/O operations, storing frequently requested documents or data blocks in memory for enhanced performance.
  
- **Asynchronous I/O:** Investigates asynchronous I/O techniques to handle file operations without blocking threads, improving scalability and responsiveness.
  
- **Security:** Implements authentication and authorization procedures to control file access and ensure data protection.
  
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Utilizes logging and monitoring features to optimize server idle time, identify issues, and analyze performance indicators.

**File Handling Functions:**

- **Upload File:** Allows clients to upload files to the server, ensuring secure and efficient transfer of data.
  
- **Rename File:** Provides functionality to rename files stored on the server, enhancing organization and accessibility.
  
- **Download File:** Enables clients to download files from the server, facilitating seamless retrieval of data.
